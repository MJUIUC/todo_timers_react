# Todo Timers
I got asked this in a full stack interview. It was pretty damn involved so I did it again later for fun.

## The Problem
Create  a list of todo timers which timeout after some specified amount of time. You should be able to add, remove, and update timers. You should also be able to start and stop timers. When a timer times out, it should be removed from view.

## Start the app
To start this app, `npm install` and then run `npm start` in the root directory. This will start the server and the client.
